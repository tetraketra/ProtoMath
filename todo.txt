INPUTS
 - image (bmp, black/white only)
 - accel data (in this case mouse)

OBJECTIVE
 - 'render' an animation of the image moving to the console [using os.flush() I guess].
   - No luminance, just on/off! 
 - Use mouse accel to apply bouncy (bounce-back) movement based on velocity to the image.

Lets start by reading mouse location for accel data and animating in the console! 2d only.
